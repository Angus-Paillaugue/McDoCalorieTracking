# TODO:

- [x] Add groups to product to filter them in top-level-groups in the product page and also, pill checkboxes like in YouTube music
- [ ] Be able to group products sizes into a single entry to display and the user can choose the size thru radio buttons (a single grid row with inactive buttons having `bg-background border border-border rounded` and the active one having `bg-primary rounded-none text-secondary`)
